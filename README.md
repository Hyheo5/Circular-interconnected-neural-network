# Circular-interconnected-neural-network

will be updated

for now I uploaded my jupyter notebook and its HTML form

note that in the notebook there is a google docs link to the describing document

Overall code is modified from https://github.com/TheIndependentCode/Neural-Network

What I build new to this code is "class Circular"
